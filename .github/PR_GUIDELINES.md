# Pull Request Guidelines

## PR Message Format

When creating PRs, use the following format:

```markdown
## Summary
- List of key changes
- One bullet point per major change

## Test plan
- [ ] Test case 1
- [ ] Test case 2
```

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** include "Generated with Claude Code" or similar attribution footers
- Keep PR messages concise and focused on the changes
- Use present tense in commit messages
- Reference related issues when applicable
